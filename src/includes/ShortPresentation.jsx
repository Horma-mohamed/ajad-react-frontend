The non-governmental organization Association Jeunesse Action Développement (AJAD) is a Mauritanian non-profit voluntary development organization. 
AJAD was created in 1997 by a group of young Mauritanians with the aim of protecting the national youth from the various temptations that can lead them to debauchery and marginalization and to bring the youth to participate effectively and efficiently in the national construction effort by subscribing to actions to fight against poverty, food insecurity and the degradation of social services (education and health). 
Consequently, AJAD was created as a tool for capacity building and promotion that allows young people and women to fully play their role as development actors.
AJAD is officially recognized by virtue of the receipt N° 0723 MIPT of 11.11.1998 and is managed by a General Assembly and a Board of Directors composed of an Executive Bureau and an Advisory Bureau.
